I am looking for an entry level position in software development, where i can develop my skills as a self taught programmer and continue to follow my passion for coding, during my time studying at the university of leeds i used python libraries like numpy and matplotlib to run numerical simulations; this sparked my interest for coding which i have expanded on by completing a full time software development bootcamp to round out these skills and knowledge.
